Overview

CM Short URL is a Joomla! component for shortening URL, it also provides option to add Google Analytics tracking parameters to URL before shortening and option to log visits of shortened URLs.

If your Joomla! ecommerce site has a long URL like this::

	http://www.yourstore.com/shop/categories/sale-off/christmas-sale

Why don't make it shorter like this before sharing it on Facebook, Twitter or forums::

	http://www.yourstore.com/off/christmas

If the long URL is changed, you can simply change it in CM Short URL and the short URL

::

	http://www.yoursite.com/go/chrismas-sale

still works and takes your customers to the correct page for Chrismas products.

The short URL is easier to remember, easier to share while talking, easier and faster to type in mobile devices.
